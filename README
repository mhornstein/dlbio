This repository contains 4 scripts.
We were asked to provide mainly the first one (evaluator.py) - it is operates according to the assigment requirements, and further explainations about its operation is provided next. Note that it uses code imported from the other code-files submitted, so please make sure they appear in the same directory upon execution.

However, we also provide all the code we made use of as part of the content of this project, along with instructions how to run each.

The scripts and their purpose are:
1. evaluator.py: used for training and evaluating the chosen neural networks architecture for an *individual* RBP.
2. experimenter.py: This script automates the process of conducting experiments with various neural networks configurations.
It runs a given number of experiments, in each - a random configuration and an RBP are sampled out of the training-RBPs, i.e. RBP 1-16.
The training and evaluation results of each experiment are recorded.
3. testet.py: used for training and conducting predictions using the chosen neural network configuration for a set of RBPs.
4. corr_plotter.py: small utility script for calculating and visualizing the correlations between RBPs' gold intensities and the predictions.

This scripts all use Pytorch, so Pytorch warnings might be presented to the console as well as the scripts output.

Following are instructions how to run each script:

Evaluator.py
------------
Usage:
python evaluator.py [path to RNAcompete_sequences file] [one or more RBNS files for training]

example:
python evaluator.py ./data/RNAcompete_sequences.txt ./data/RBNS_training/RBP2_5nM.seq ./data/RBNS_training/RBP2_20nM.seq ./data/RBNS_training/RBP2_80nM.seq ./data/RBNS_training/RBP2_320nM.seq ./data/RBNS_training/RBP2_1300nM.seq ./data/RBNS_training/RBP2_input.seq

The script general flow is:
1. Parse RBNS files.
2. Create positive + negative samples.
3. Train the model according to the final chosen architecture.
4. Get model classification on rna_compete_file intensities.

Results:
* A model will be trained according to the RBNs files.
* The progress will be displayed in the console.
* The prediction probabilities (i.e. the scores) will be written to the generated scores.txt file.

experimenter.py:
----------------
Usage:
python experimenter.py [path to RNAcompete_sequences file] [path to RBNS_training directory] [path to RNCMPT_training directory] [number of experiments to conduct]

Example:
python experimenter.py ./data/RNAcompete_sequences.txt ./data/RBNS_training ./data/RNCMPT_training 5

Results:
* The progress will be displayed in the console.
* A "result" directory will be created (if not already existed). It will contain the following:
    - measurements.csv – a CSV file logging each experiment ID, the sampled configuration, and the experiment results (loss, accuracy, time, etc).
    - A directory for each experiment ID – containing accuracy and loss graphs, as well as the raw training results data.
Note: If you wish to conduct more experiments, simply re-run the experimenter.py again: It will fetch the last experiment ID from the measurements.csv and continue from there.

Link for output example:

tester.py
-----------
Usage:
python tester.py [path to RNAcompete_sequences file] [directory of the RBNS-test files] [result directory]

example:
python tester.py .\data\RNAcompete_sequences.txt .\data\RBNS_training train_results
or:
python tester.py .\data\RNAcompete_sequences.txt .\data\RBNS_testing test_results

Results:
* A model will be trained for each RBP found in the directory.
* The trained model will then be used to predict the intensity of the RNA sequences provided in the RNAcompete sequences file:
    - The prediction probabilities will be written to separate text files, with each file named after the corresponding RBP, e.g. RBP1.txt will contain the predictions for RBP number 1.
    - The directory will also include a " train_result" directory with individual directories for each RBP, containing information about the training performance.
* The progress will be displayed in the console.

Link for output example:

corr_plotter.py
---------------
Usage:
python corr_plotter.py [path to gold-scores directory] [path to predicted-scores directory] [results directory]

example:
python corr_plotter.py data/RNCMPT_training train_set_results corr_report
where:
data/RNCMPT_training – was provided as part of the assignment.
train_set_results – is the output directory of the tester.py script.

Explainations about the parameters:
* path to gold-scores directory: A string representing the directory path where the gold (actual) scores for the RNCMPT training data are stored.
It should contain files of the form RBP1.txt...RBP16.txt.
* path to predicted-scores directory: A string representing the directory path where the predicted scores for the RNCMPT training data are stored.
These predicted scores are the output of the model's predictions for the training data. They can be created using the tester.py script.
It should contain files of the same form as gold_dir, i.e. RBP1.txt...RBP16.txt.
* results directory: The directory where the results should be saved.

Results:
The result will contain a CSV containing the correlation scores and a corresponding box plot.

Requirements
------------
The necessary libraries that need to be installed are listed in the requirements.txt file. You can install all by using pip install.
Note: We use the slim version of Pytorch as we ran the scripts only on machines that do not have GPUs.

Tests
-----
All code was tourouly ran and tested on:
* Windows machine with Python 3.10.8.
* Unix machine with Python 3.9.2.
